           <p id='narrative'>Hi, I'm Sarah from Torrance, CA! I'm a fashion designer turned software engineer. Complete 180, I know, but I'm always eager for new opportunities to broaden my skills and knowledge whether it's for a whole career change or just for fun! My main priority is bridging the gap between technology and humanity by creating easy-to-use apps for everyone ranging from my future kids to my 94 year old grandma. Some things I love to do outside of the tech world are golfing, cooking, and styling my family and friends.</p>
